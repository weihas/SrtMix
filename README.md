# SrtMix [(Download)](https://github.com/weihas/SrtMix/releases/download/v1.1/SrtMix.dmg) 
### v1.1 (Both on AppleSilicon and Intel Mac)

When I watched the video on the iPad yesterday, I found that the player (**Infuse**) can only play one of the Chinese or English subtitles. This makes me feel a little uncomfortable. I prefer Chinese, but some words can only be expressed well in English, so I hope to display both Chinese and English. So it took me three hours to finish this app. It's very simple, just fusion subtitles, and there are no other redundant functions.

### How to Use

+ You can click the “**Download**” link above to download 
+ Double click the SrtMix.dmg
    - I don't think users need to convert subtitles every day, so this program does not need to be installed to avoid subsequent uninstalling.
    - You only need to load to run.
+ When you open the app, it has only one interface, which is very concise :
    - Click the "**中**" button to pop up the window to select the Chinese subtitles to be mixed.
    - Click the "**E**" button to pop up the window to select the English subtitles to be mixed.
    - Check the file correct through the window in front of the button.
    - Click the “**Mix&Save**” button. If it is successfully converted, the progress bar below will be completed, then pop up the file save window, select the saved name and path, and click Save


### Uninstall and delete
When you complete the transformation, you just need to close the window and push the SrtMix.Dmg out to stop loading, which will not contain any residues.
